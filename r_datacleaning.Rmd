## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```




```{r cars}
lux_df = read.csv("lux_stats.csv",header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
#draw the preivous data set: relationship between time and gold spent
previous_plot =  ggplot(lux_df,aes(x = time, y = goldspent)) + geom_point(shape = 18)
previous_plot
```


```{r}
#outlier detection 

outlier_location <- sapply(lux_df, function(x){which(x %in%boxplot.stats(x)$out )})    # detect the outlier and merge
outlier_location_total <- c(sort(unique(c(outlier_location$time,outlier_location$goldspent))))
cleaned_lux_df <- lux_df
cleaned_lux_df <- cleaned_lux_df[-outlier_location_total,]        #delete the outlier 

rownames(cleaned_lux_df) <- 1:nrow(cleaned_lux_df)   #reset index
```
```{r}
# plot  the cleaned data set 
cleaned_plot = ggplot(cleaned_lux_df,aes(x = time, y = goldspent)) + geom_point(shape = 18)
cleaned_plot
```
```{r}
length(outlier_location_total)

```




Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
